					<hr>
					<p>It's my first time to watch sport on sport day (Normally I don't watch at all). Why? because it's a volleyball match between team C which is my team and team A. And I have to say, it's a very enjoyable match. Both team played so well, very well actually. I thought I was seeing some profressional level volleyball (exagg). But what's made this game really fun was, both team were equally skilled. Seeing the score went back and forth is hearthwrenching. </p>
					<p>And the main reason that this match made me felt so good is, we won! (actually they won, but we're on the same team right? right?). It was a very tight game and both team were playing their best. So seeing my friend won the game make me feel so happy.</p>

					<p>Interesting... server side programming on front-end language. I was planned to learn it someday, because it can be very useful in the future. Heck, it might even be useful in my KU development.</p>
					<p>This take me to webapp version of KU, but I've never done it before, so it's going to be the whole new topic for me to learn.</p>

					<h1 style="text-align: center">KVIS utilltiy on hold</h1>

					<hr>
					<p>Finally, just released the most complete version of KVIS utillity app (KU) to my friend. Seriously, developing application sure drain my energy out. Even it's just a small applcation. Still, I learnt a lot from this project. OOP is difficult to undestand but it can be fun and inuitive. Look like next time I've to learn about swift so I can crease IOS version.</p>
					<p>Today is another sport day. Look like we have football and volleyball today, but I have to be in club so it seem like  I can't go cheer them (even I don't have club I'd still doubt myself if I'll go cheer them, but I haven't touch sport for a while now so.... </p>
